Install and attach the `Rvest` package. You can find more information about the package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf)

```{r, results = 'hide', solution = TRUE}

# installing package
install.packages("rvest")

# attaching package
library(rvest)

```

You can also add some markdown formatted text with the asis engine together with `solution = TRUE`

```{block, solution = TRUE}
This is the text explaining how to obtain the solution and written in **Rmarkdown**
```

Use the knit dropdown menu on the knit button to generate the desired output:

- Using `unilur::tutorial_pdf_solution` or `unilur::tutorial_html_solution` will show the solution boxes.
- Using `unilur::tutorial_pdf` or `unilur::tutorial_html` will hide them from the output.

```{block, box.title = "Tip", box.body = list(fill = "lightblue")}
You can also include custom boxes to highlight some content. Read the [article](http://koncina.github.io/unilur/articles/custom-boxes.html) to learn more about how to customize the appearance.
