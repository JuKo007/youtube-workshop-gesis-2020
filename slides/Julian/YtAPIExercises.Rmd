# Exercise 1

Install and attach the `Rvest` package. You can find more information about the package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf)

```{r, results = 'hide', solution = TRUE}

# installing package
install.packages("rvest", quiet = TRUE)

# attaching package
library(rvest, warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)

```

# Exercise 2

Go to the Wikipedia Entry of YouTube in your `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube` Browser and find the Xpath that corresponds to the whole table on the right side of the screen.

```{block, box.title = "Tip", box.body = list(fill = "lightblue")}
You can do this in Google Chrome by going to the website, right clicking on the page and clicking on
**inspect**. Alternatively, you can just press **Ctrl + Alt + I**. By expanding the containers and hovering your mouse over them, you can see which elements on the website they correpsond to. To copy the Xpath of an element, right-click
on the container and select **copy** -> **Copy full Xpath**. Be carefull to select the HTML that encompasses the entire table and not only parts of it
```

```{r, results = 'hide', solution = TRUE}
TablePath <- "/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[4]/div/table[1]"
```

# Exercise 3

Using the Xpath extract the information from the table

```{block, box.title = "Tip", box.body = list(fill = "lightblue")}
Use the `read_html()`, `html_nodes()` and `html_table()` functions. You can read more about them in the Help panel in R studio or by calling them preceded by two question marks, e.g. `??read_html()`.
```

```{r, results = 'hide' ,solution = TRUE}
# Setting URL
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"

# Reading HTML from URL
html <- read_html(url)

# Navigating to the HTML node with the table object
Node <- html_nodes(html, xpath = TablePath)

# Extracting the table to R-object
Table <- html_table(Node)

# unlisting dataframe
YouTubeData <- Table[[1]]

```
