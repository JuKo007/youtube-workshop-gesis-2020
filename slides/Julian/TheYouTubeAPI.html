# The YouTube API

---
# Overview

- All data on YouTube is stored in a [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) database
 
- The website itself is an HTML page, which loads content from this database

- The HTML is rendered by a webbrowser so the user can interact with it

- Through interacting with the rendered website, we can either retrieve content from the database
or send content to the database

- The Youtube Website is
    - build in [HTML](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language), 
    - uses [CSS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) for the "styling"
    - dynamically loads content using [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax) from the Database

# How do we get data from Websites?

- Theoretically, we could gather all the information manually by clicking on the things that are
 interesting to us and copy/pasting them. However, this is tedious and time-consuming.**We want a way
 of automatizing this task**

- [Webscraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)

 1)  **Screenscraping:** Getting the HTML-code out of your browser, parsing &amp; formatting it, then analyzing the data
  
 2)  **API-harvesting:** Sending requests directly to the database and only getting back the information that you want and need.

# Screenscraping

---
# Screenscraping

- Screenscraping means that we are downloading the HTML textfile, which contains the content we are interested in but also a lot of unnecessary clutter that describes how the website should be rendered by the browser

# Screenscraping

- To automatically obtain data, we can use a so called [GET request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)

- A GET request is an HTTP method for asking a server to send a specific resource (usually an HTML page) back
to your local machine

- You can try it out in your console with the command:
  
  .small[GET https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol]

- This is the basic principle that all the Scraping packages build-on.

- We will not use this directly and will let the higher-level applications handle this under the hood

# Screenscraping with Rvest


```r
# installing and attaching package
if ("rvest" %in% installed.packages() != TRUE) {
  install.packages("rvest")};library(rvest)
## Loading required package: xml2

# getting page
Website &lt;- read_html(page)

# getting node containing the description

# printing description
html_attr(Description, name = "content")
```

# Screenscraping

- **Problem:** We only get part of the decsription, the text seems to cut off at a certain point

- This happens because on Youtube is a **dynamic** website that loads new content based on what users do on the website. With some actions, the HTML of the site changes without having to reload:
    - More comments only load when you scroll down
    - You have to click on "show more" to see the video description
    - you have to click on "show answers" to see more comment replies
  
- This makes screenscraping **a lot** harder

- Most social media websites and websites with multimedia content are dynamic

# Screenscraping with RSelenium


```r
# We first have to configure docker and open a docker container:
# https://callumgwtaylor.github.io/blog/2018/02/01/using-rselenium-and-docker-to-webscrape-in-r-using-the-who-snake-database/

# installing packages
if ("RSelenium" %in% installed.packages() != TRUE) {
  install.packages("RSelenium")
}

# attaching package
library(RSelenium)

# opening docker container from system
check &lt;- system2("docker", args = "ps", stdout = TRUE)
```
---
# Screenscraping with RSelenium


```r
# opening new container (and killing old ones)
if (length(check) == 1) {
  
  #start new container
  system2("docker", args = c("run", "-d", "-p", "4445:4444", "selenium/standalone-chrome"))
  
} else {
  
  # kill old container
  DockerName &lt;- trimws(strsplit(check[2],"tcp")[[1]][2])
  system2("docker", args = c("kill",DockerName))
  
  # start new container
  system2("docker", args = c("run", "-d", "-p", "4445:4444", "selenium/standalone-chrome"))
  
}
```
---
# Screenscraping with RSelenium


```r
# Assigning google chrome docker session
remDr &lt;- RSelenium::remoteDriver(remoteServerAddr = "localhost",
                                 port = 4445L,
                                 browserName = "chrome")

# Waiting for 5 seconds to finish initialization of docker session
Sys.sleep(5)
```

---
# Screenscraping with RSelenium

- We can now navigate to a website and print a screenshot


```r
# Open remote connection
remDr$open()

# Navigate to website
remDr$navigate("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PqdqWWSHJY")

# Wait for 2 seconds for the website to load
Sys.sleep(2)

# Scrolling down a bit
webElem &lt;- remDr$findElement("css", "body")
webElem$sendKeysToElement(list(key = "down_arrow"))

# take screenshot
remDr$screenshot(file = 'Images/RSeleniumScreenshot.png')
```

---
# Screenshot 

![plot](Images/RSeleniumScreenshot.png)

---
# Screenscraping with RSelenium

 - We can then navigate to the "show more" button, and click it


```r
# Xpath of "show more" button (using inspect element in Browser)
xp &lt;- '//*[@id="more"]/yt-formatted-string'

# navigating to button element
element &lt;- remDr$findElement(using = 'xpath', xp)

# click on button
element$clickElement()

# Scrolling down a bit
webElem &lt;- remDr$findElement("css", "body")
webElem$sendKeysToElement(list(key = "down_arrow"))

# take screenshot (we can see that the description box is now expanded)
remDr$screenshot(file = 'Images/RSeleniumScreenshot2.png')
```
---
# Screenshot 

![plot](Images/RSeleniumScreenshot2.png)

---
# Screenscraping with RSelenium

- We can then extract the contents of the expanded description box


```r
#navigating to description element
xp2 &lt;- '//*[@id="description"]/yt-formatted-string'
element2 &lt;- remDr$findElement(using = 'xpath', xp2)

# get element text
unlist(element2$getElementText())
```

# Screenscraping

- Advantages of Screenscraping:
  + You can access everything that you are able to access from your browser
  + You are (theoretically) not restricted in how much data you can get
  + (Theoretically) Independent from API-restrictions

- Disadvantages of Screenscraping:
  - Extremely tedious to get information out of HTML-pages
  - You have to manually look up the Xpaths/CSS/HTML containers to get specific information
  - Reproducibility: The website might be tailored to stuff in your Cache, Cookies, Accounts etc.
  - There is no guarantee that even pages that look the same have the same underlying HTML structure
  - You have to manually check the website and your data to make sure that you're getting what you want
  - If the website changes anything in their styling, your scripts won't work anymore
  - Legal Gray Area (recent [court ruling](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/09/09/17-16783.pdf) though)

# API-Harvesting

---
# API-harvesting

- An [**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface]([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) is:
  - system build for developers
  - directly communicate with the database
  - Voluntary service of the website
  - they can dictate what information is accessible, to whom, how, and in which quantities.

![plot](Images/API_harvesting.png)

---
# API-harvesting

- APIs can be used to:

  - embed content in other applications
  - create Bots that do something automatically
  - scheduling/moderation for content creators
  - collect data for (market) research purposes

- Not every website has their own API. However, most large Social Media Websites do
  - [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api?locale=de_DE)
  - [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started)
  - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/)
  - [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Technik/Datenbank/API)
  - [Google Maps](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/google-maps-places)

---
# API-harvesting

- Advantages of API-harvesting:
  + No need to interact with HTML files, you only get the information you asked for
  + The data you get is already nicely formatted (usually JSON files)
  + You can be sure that what you do is perfectly legal and in line with ToS

- Disadvantages of API-harvesting:
  - Not every website has an API
  - You can only get what the company allows you to get
  - There are often restricting quotas (querys per day)
  - there is no standard language to make querys, you have to check the documentation
  - Not every API has a documentation

# Screenscraping vs. API-harvesting

If you can, use an API, if you must, use Screenscraping instead

# The YouTube API

---
# Summary

- Fortunately, YouTube has their own, well-documented API
  that developers can use to interact with their database (Most Google Services do)

- To find an API for a given website, [Programmable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com) is
  a good starting point

- We will use the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs) today

---
# Let's check the API

- Google provides a sandbox for their API that we can use to get a grasp of how it operates

- We can for example use our credentials to get search for videos with the keyword "Brexit"

- [Example](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list?apix_params=%7B%22part%22%3A%22snippet%22%2C%22q%22%3A%22Brexit%22%7D)

- Keep in mind: We have to log in with our created Google account to use the API

- What we get back is a JSON formatted response with the formats and information we requested in the Sandbox

---
# Most important parameters:

- All possible parameters are listed [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/)

- Keep in mind that some information is only visible to owners of a channel or author of a video

- Keep in mind that not all information is necessarily available for all videos (e.g. live videos)

---
# Using it from R

- We can simplyfiy the process of interacting with the YouTube API by using a dedicated R package

- The package handles the authentification with our credentials and translates R commands into API calls

- In essence, we can run R commands and get API results back

&lt;!--  .center[![plot](Images/MuchWin.jpeg)] --&gt; 

- For this workshop, we will use the [tubeR package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tuber/tuber.pdf)

---
# Rate Limits

- With the API, you have a limit of how much data you can get

- This limit has constantly decreased over the last decade

.center[![plot](Images/RateLimitReduction3.png)]

---
# Rate Limits

- Currently (02.2020), you have a quota of **10.000** units per day

- Each request (even invalid ones) costs a certain amount of units

- There are two factors influencing the quota cost of each request:

  - different types (e.g write operation: 50 units; video upload: 1600 units)
  
  - how many parts the requested resource has (playlist:2; channel: 6; video: 10)
  
- **You should only request parts that you absolutely need to make the most of your units** 

- **BEWARE: Sending one wrong request can fill up your daily quota**
