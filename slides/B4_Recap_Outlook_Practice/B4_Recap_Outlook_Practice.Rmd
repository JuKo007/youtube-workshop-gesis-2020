# Where to go From Here?

Some topics that we did not cover or only briefly touched upon that you might want to explore next/further:

- Analyses for more than one video: use for-loops, functions from the `apply` family or `map` functions from the [`purrr` package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)

- Advanced text mining and NLP: check out the introductions/tutorials mentioned in the session on basic text analysis and/or the *GESIS* workshop ["Research Factory for Text Mining in the Social Sciences"](https://training.gesis.org/?site=pDetails&child=full&pID=0x7C279142645144CB854441D0AD613445), March 23-25, Cologne

- Topic models: have a look at the introductions/tutorials by [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/sherlock-holmes-stm/) and the [*Pew Research Center*](https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/an-intro-to-topic-models-for-text-analysis-de5aa3e72bdb)

# Acknowledgements `r ji("heart")`

All slides were created with the `R` package [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) which builds on [`remark.js`](https://remarkjs.com), [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [`R Markdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The exercises were created with the [`unilur` package](https://github.com/koncina/unilur).  

The original inspiration for our emoji parsing and analyses came from a [blog post](http://opiateforthemass.es/articles/emoji-analysis/) by [Jessica Peterka-Bonetta](https://github.com/today-is-a-good-day). The `workshop.css` file we used for the layout of the slides includes elements from `CSS` files for `xaringan` presentations by [Frederik Aust](https://github.com/crsh) and [David Zimmer](https://github.com/DavZim).  

We thank Laura RÃ¼we and the *GESIS* Training team for taking good care of the organization of this workshop, and all of you for participating!

# Practice time
## You now have some time to start or continue working on your own *YouTube* data analysis project. We'll be around, so feel free to ask questions.
